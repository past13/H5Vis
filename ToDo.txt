Initialization:
    Display Loading div/label
    Load configuration xml
    Load recipe xml
    For each orderline/containertype:
        (read orderline data from xml)
        Create "default" mesh based on LxWxH (and maybe top/bottom nonsupport border)
    Create scenes/views/divs
    Show divs/views
    Hide loading div/label

After everything has loaded and is now visible on screen:
    For each orderline/containertype:
        If <model> is defined, start loading that model3D (do a request)
            => OnLoadingComplete(): replaces the "default" mesh
            => OnLoadingError(): ? ignore?
